## Repository Index

An index for all DVLab's repositories. Written in Vue with typescript support.

### Private repositories

To include private repositories, you must set a valid personal token into your local storage.  
To obtain a valid token follow https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token.  
Then open your browser dev console and run `localStorage.setItem("githubKey", "yourTokenHere")`.

### Dev

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies, then `yarn serve` will run the dev server on localhost:8080.
